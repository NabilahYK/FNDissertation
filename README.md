# FNDissertation

This repository contains my MSc Data Science dissertation project, completed at the University of York. The work explores the prediction of high-risk febrile neutropenia in paediatric cancer patients using real-world healthcare data.

I developed an interpretable XGBoost model as part of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and ethical AI in healthcare. This project reflects my interest in using data science to support decision-making in clinical settings, and in building tools that are both impactful and user-friendly.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook

- [`FebrileDisso.ipynb`](./FebrileDisso.ipynb): Main analysis notebook, covering:
  - Data wrangling and cleaning using `pandas`
  - Visualisation with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Model development and tuning with `scikit-learn` and `XGBoost`
  - Evaluation using ROC-AUC, precision-recall metrics
  - Commentary on ethical considerations, including GDPR and Caldicott Principles
  - Designed with non-technical end users in mind (dashboard elements)

## My key focus, aims and outcomes: 

- Applied machine learning to a real-world healthcare challenge
- Focused on interpretability and stakeholder communication
- Developed and evaluated models using sound statistical methodology
- Embedded responsible data handling throughout
- Documented the entire process for reproducibility and transparency

## Toolsdemonstrated:

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data storytelling and stakeholder-aligned visualisation
- Ethical data handling (UK GDPR, Caldicott)
